name: Values aligned
brief: |
    Often times human editors of documents will align the values even
    though YAML emitters generally don't.
yaml: |
    ---
    red:   baron
    white: walls
    blue:  berries
perl: |
    {
     red => 'baron',
     white => 'walls',
     blue => 'berries',
    }

    Spaces can come before the ': ' key/value separator.
