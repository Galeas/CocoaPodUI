name: Quoted line noise key
type: load-expect
brief: |
    Check that quoted line noise parses as key.
yaml: |
    ---
    "!@#%" : bar baz
perl: |
    {'!@#%' => 'bar baz'}
ruby: |
    {'!@#%', 'bar baz'}

---
name: Unquoted line noise key
brief: |
    Check that unquoted line noise parses as key.
    This requires the line noise be tame enough
    to pass as an implicit plain key.
yaml: |
    ---
    -+!@#% : bar baz
perl: |
    {'-+!@#%' => 'bar baz'}
ruby: |
    {'-+!@#%', 'bar baz'}
